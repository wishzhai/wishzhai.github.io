My research goal is to enhance musical expressiveness beyond traditional notation and to explore generative AI for marginalized or underrepresented music. I am particularly interested in pushing the boundaries of possibility in AI-driven music, sometimes exploring endless creative pathways that conventional approaches cannot reach. After participating in Prof. Ken Fields' Digiscore workshop in the context of AI, I realized that Digiscore can benefit both professional and amateur users. By visualizing music, it makes sonic material more tangible and opens up new possibilities for performance. I am therefore exploring multimodal approaches that combine generative music with interactive visualizations, enabling more creative and expressive music generation.
