I am currently a Master’s student in Music at Quanzhou Normal University, supervised by Prof. Jianbin Xiahou, where I participate in the AI-Based Music Generation on Nanyin Music project (Project No. FJ2023JDZ050). My research integrates deep learning with the traditional Nanyin genre, aiming to bridge symbolic representation with the revival of this UNESCO-recognized heterophonic tradition.

Since Nanyin notation captures only the skeletal melody, its essence lies in ornaments and playing techniques. I am therefore particularly interested in expressive MIDI generation and audio synthesis that models playing techniques. Recent contributions include a demo at ISMIR LBD 2025 on expressive MIDI ornament generation, participation in RenCon 2025 for performance rendering, a presentation at HCMIR 2025 discussing improvements to interpolation-based creative music generation systems, and a poster at LLM4Music @ ISMIR 2025 on using large language models to generate audibly challenging music in IDM-like styles.

My long-term goal is to develop human-centered generative AI for music by unifying notation, performance, and timbre. I plan to achieve this by designing interactive interfaces for creative exploration and by leveraging advanced tokenization techniques (e.g., VQ, RVQ). This work aims to empower the generation of nuanced and complex styles, such as free jazz and experimental electronica.
