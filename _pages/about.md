<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I am a Master’s student in Music at Quanzhou Normal University, supervised by Prof. Jianbin Xiahou, participating in the AI-Based Music Generation on Nanyin Music project (Project No. FJ2023JDZ050). My research combines deep learning with the traditional Nanyin genre, aiming to bridge symbolic representation and the revival of this UNESCO-recognized heterophonic musical tradition.

Since Nanyin notation captures only the skeletal melody, its essence lies in ornaments and playing techniques. I am therefore particularly interested in expressive MIDI generation and audio synthesis that models playing techniques. Recent contributions include a demo at ISMIR LBD 2025 on expressive MIDI ornament generation, participation in RenCon 2025 for performance rendering, a presentation at HCMIR 2025 discussing improvements to interpolation-based creative music generation systems, and a poster at LLM4Music @ ISMIR 2025 on using large language models to generate audibly challenging music in IDM-like styles.

My ongoing research explores cutting-edge tokenization techniques such as Vector Quantization, Residual VQ, and Finite Scalar Quantization, with potential applications extending from free jazz to chopped breakbeats and experimental works by artists like Burnt Friedman. My long-term goal is to develop human-centered generative AI that unifies notation, performance, and timbre to enable creativity-driven music and audio generation.
